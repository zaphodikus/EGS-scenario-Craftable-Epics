A quick-start in the Vanilla universe of v1.4X but with less focus on combat skill, and more on resource gathering and trade to craft all Epic Items. Do you always use higher difficulty settings, but for more realism and more start resources? A few new recipes are thrown in to make combat easier, movement better, chainsaw better.
