## Craftable Epics
A scenario or mod for the Empyrion Galactic survival game

### Craftable Epics, for the golden age
[Zaphodikus Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337746040)
I designed this configuration mod as a subset of the game changes I have been playing for a long time now. This works in single player and does not change play balance significantly enough to make multiplayer any less fun, if not more. You start with some resources and a decent weapon, which basically skips the tedium of day 1 and 2 in-game.

Best played with medium tech advances, and every other setting amped up to hardest difficulty. If you are a senior gamer like myself, you will probably be playing on this kind of difficulty setting, and love the ability to get epics without risking your life. Expecially if you prefer an almost-hardcore style
* Almost all epic items are craft-able, you will need the prior-level item to the epic, an Advanced constructor, some gold and a few other rare materials * for each epic item.
* Bio fuel is a bit easier to make. Chainsaw runs for a bit longer.
* T2 shield gen
* Suit boosters are craft-able

I may have left a gift in one of the large constructors.

Vanilla playfields are Version 1.3 build 3209
